            <p>First of all, thank you for visiting my website. My name is Jacob Soriano Ong, currently studying Computer Science at the University of Saint Louis Tuguegarao. I love music and when there is time, I write poems and draw things. I started this course because I looked up computers since I was little, and now that I am old, technology keeps evolving and evolving. Although this was not my priority when entering college, Architecture was my priority. I did not receive any emails or calls from the University where I enrolled and proceeded to pursue Computer Science. I want to be a full-stack developer or Software engineer in the future and heard that you need to study Computer Science/IT to become one(although not totally). Five years from now, I can see myself either struggling in debugging or landing a job, but who knows what will happen in the future because I wanted to be an astronaut when I was like... seven years old.  </p>

        <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <progress value="79" max="100">60</progress>
        <p>I am a creative person, I like to imagine things, on how they operate and on how things work. I also like to experiment things that is why I rated myself that way.</p>
        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <progress value="80" max="100">60</progress>
        <p>I like to solve problems because I want to know why it happens and sometimes the answer can be the most exhilarating thing that could ever happen.</p>
        <h3>Teamwork</h3>
        <progress value="70" max="100">60</progress>
        <p>In a group of people, I can do the work that is assigned to me and mostly do things on my own but I also ask for validation from the group if I want to do something that can affect all of us.</p>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <progress value="60" max="100">60</progress>
        <p>My communication skill is in the middle since it is hard for me to share knowledge and sometimes when I share, it's already late.</p>
        <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
        <progress value="80" max="100">60</progress>
        <p>I rated my critical thinking this way because I always plan before I do things, on how things can greatly affect any decision made by me and on how I can benefit from those decisions.</p>

            <h2>First Year...</h2>
            <p>I studied Computer Science in Cagayan State University Carig Campus during my first year. The environment feels different than what I have used to, the people is different, their attitude and everything is also different. To sum it up, I am not used to it. My academic journey there was hard because my laptop is not working for many months and as you know, a computer is a must in this course. Guess what I have use during that time... Ofcourse, it is a phone and it is so mind boggling. The small screen size, finding compilers in the playstore(yes I know, there is a website) and the whole experience is a torture. I don't really know much in coding when I have taken this course but I gaslight myself into thinking that I know it and sometimes it works but most of the time I just browse in the web to learn more things that is related in my course. I did well during the first semester until my laptop is not working anymore and it affected my performance during the second semester. My grades have been affected ofcourse but there is still chance next time and that is always what I say all this time. Hopefully, I passed all my subjects that time and that's what matter the most. Sadly, my journey ends in CSU after my first year because of some personal matters. </p>

            <h2>Second Year...</h2>
            <p>After my academic journey in Cagayan State University, I transferred at University of Saint Louis Tuguegarao to continue studying Computer Science. I am glad that I have retained my year transferring although I am still an irregular, it does not bother me. I have met wonderful people in my stay here, and hoping to meet more of them in the coming years. During the First Semester, I think I did well in my subjects. The professors here are great, they teach very well and sometimes it makes coding easier(if this is a thing). I have learned a lot of things that I have not learned in my first year and I am glad that I have retained most of the things that I have learned. I have learned about the basics of programming, the fundamentals of programming, the basics of web development, the human-computer interaction and more. Even though I didn't reach my goal for the first semester, I am still happy with what I have learned and I am glad with my performance. I am hoping that I will do better in this second semester. I still wish that none of us will be left behind because we are just a small group of students. </p>
